\begin{abstract}
    Despite the advancement in fitting approaches, RANSAC  is a good algorithm that can deal with higher outlier ratios up to 50\%.    In this report, we will talk about the implementation of RANSAC in two different situations. In the first part of the report, we will fit a circle with given points. Then we try to fit two shapes using homographic transformation. In the third part, we will analyze an application of finding homographic transformation between two images. Finally, we will try to generalize the RANSAC approach to find the best circle and suitable homographic transformation used in stitching two images.
