\section{Fitting Circle}
Any circle can be defined by a minimum of three points. That is a circle is fully defined if it is expected to go through three points. Hence it is not suitable to fit a circle accurately with a given number of points.  By defining the total euclidean distances as the measure of error, a better choice for the circular fit can be achieved. 

 
\subsection*{Randy Bullock}
Two famous approaches for the fitting circle are circular regression and randy bullock fit. In this report we will focus on implementation of \textit{randy bullock} algorithm to fit circles into given points.
