\section{Super-Imposing Images}
Super-imposed images look strange if they have different orientations and translations. In fitting an image in a specific location of background, it is crucial to ensure the images are matching properly.  This can be performed by finding homographic transformation between two images and transforming one image into the other domain before image stitching.
\par 
The following implementation matches four corners of two billboards with two posters shown next to them(\ref{ps}).  Although the matching seems to have better performance(\ref{rst_1}) it required some fine-tuning along the way. It is because four matches alone are not sufficient enough to find an exact homographic transformation.
